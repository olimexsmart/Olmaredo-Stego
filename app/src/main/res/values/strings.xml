    <string name="info">This app lets you to hide a message in an image in order to communicate secretly.\n
        The steganographic process needs a signature derived from the autocorrelation matrix
        of the original image, like a sort of key. You can clip it after the encoding process is complete and share it
        with your partner that will insert it into the Custo field in the decoding tab along side the image
        carrying the message. A default signature can be used but can\'t guarantee the same performance as the
        original one. \n
        In the setting tab can be specified the block dimension, the bigger, the harder to detect the information, since the
        spectrum is larger and the key is longer. But with bigger blocks the image can hold less of them, so less information can be
        included. The image height parameter sets the height dimension of the output image, bigger images can hold more information,
        but the computation can take much longer and devices with no much RAM could have problems. To give you an idea, with default
        settings the maximum length of the message is around 600 characters.
        The algorithm is based on spread-spectrum steganography, more specifically on the optimal version defined by
        Gkizeli, Pados and Medley that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.\n
