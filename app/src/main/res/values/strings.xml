    <string name="info">This app permits you to hide a message in an image in order to communicate secretly.\n
        It is based on the spread-spectrum steganography, more specifically on the optimal version defined by
        Gkizeli, Pados and Medley that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.\n
        The image that you upload is divided in square blocks with custom side dimension (default value is 8 pixels).
        Each bloc carry one hidden information bit and you have to define the intensity of embedding.
        The steganographic process needs a signature derived from an autocorrelation matrix
        derived from the image itself and you can enter a custom one (the default value is for generic image).\n
